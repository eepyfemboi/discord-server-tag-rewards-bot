# discord-server-tag-rewards-bot
a discord bot that rewards users for wearing your server's tag

to use it, u first need node.js and npm, and u need to install discord.js and typescript, then change the config thingies in bot.ts with ur log channel, bot token, reward role id, and target server id, then run `tsc bot.ts` to compile it to javascript then u can run `node bot.js`

its recommended to use a vps to host this for optimal uptime

if ur unsure about something, read the comments

also, check out this super cool bot kinda like owo and nekotina but without the bloat: https://sleepie.dev/bwahhh

anyway, thats all :3
